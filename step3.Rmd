## Introduction to *Identification*   

Rigorous causal inference from observational data requires translating the
scientific questions posed in **Step 1** into statistical parameters that are
identifiable from the observed data. 

Before we can run any models we must answer two questions:

1. **What exact counterfactual quantity are we after?** (The *causal estimand* defined in step 1)
2. **Can that quantity be expressed with the data we observe?** (= *identifiability*)

This **identification step** formally
links the counterfactual (causal) world to the factual world we can measure.
Doing so relies on three well-known assumptions—**Consistency, Conditional
Exchangeability, and Positivity**—described below in the context of our revised
primary and sensitivity estimands.





 # 3   Causal estimands expressed in mathematical notation
 ## 3.1 Primary – *Hypothetical no‑switch* risk at 90 days
*“What would the 90‑day cumulative risk of first AKI be if every patient stayed
on their initial regimen for the full 90 days?”*

$$
\text{RD}_{\text{NS}} = E\![Y^{a=1,\;\text{no‑switch}}] \;-
                       E\![Y^{a=0,\;\text{no‑switch}}],
\quad
\text{RR}_{\text{NS}} = \frac{E\![Y^{1,\;\text{no‑switch}}]}
                             {E\![Y^{0,\;\text{no‑switch}}]}.
$$

## 3.2 Sensitivity – Treatment‑policy (ITT) risk at 90 days
*“What is the 90‑day AKI risk difference if clinicians simply *start* SOF vs
non‑SOF, allowing any subsequent changes?”*

$$
\text{RD}_{\text{ITT}} = E\![Y^{1}] - E\![Y^{0}],
\quad
\text{RR}_{\text{ITT}} = \frac{E\![Y^{1}]}{E\![Y^{0}]}.
$$


# 4   Identification assumptions
To express those counterfactual risks with our data we need four assumptions.

## 4.1 Consistency + SUTVA
The outcome we observe equals the potential outcome under the regimen actually
received, and one patient’s treatment choice does not influence another
patient’s AKI risk.

## 4.2 Conditional exchangeability (no unmeasured confounding)

$$
Y^{a,\;\text{no‑switch}} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; A \mid W,
\quad
Y^{a} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; A \mid W.
$$

All factors that affect both initial regimen choice and AKI risk are captured
in \$W\$.

## 4.3 Positivity
*Treatment positivity* — every covariate pattern with positive probability has
some chance of receiving either regimen:

$$
0 < P(A=a\mid W) < 1.
$$

*Time‑varying positivity* (primary estimand) — no regimen‑and‑history pattern
forces an immediate switch/discontinuation over 0–90 d.

## 4.4 Independent censoring (primary estimand)
After adjusting for observed history $\bar{L}(t)$ the chance of remaining
uncensored is unrelated to the counterfactual outcome:

$$
Y^{a,\;\text{no‑switch}} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; C(t) \mid A=a,\; \bar{L}(t),\, W.
$$

We relax this by modelling the switching/death hazard and using
inverse‑probability‑of‑censoring weights (IPCW) inside the TMLE.


# 5   Observed‑data functionals (the *g‑formula*)
## 5.1 ITT estimand

$$
E\![Y^{a}] = E_{W}\bigl[\,E(Y\mid A=a, W)\bigr].
$$

## 5.2 No‑switch estimand with IPCW
Define the weight for subject *i* through 90 d:

$$
W_{i}(90) =
\prod_{t\le 90}\frac{P\{C_{i}(t)=0\mid A_{i}=a, W_{i}\}}
                        {P\{C_{i}(t)=0\mid A_{i}=a, \bar{L}_{i}(t), W_{i}\}}.
$$

Then

$$
E\![Y^{a,\;\text{no‑switch}}] = E\bigl[\,W_{i}(90)\,Y_{i}\bigr].
$$

Our one‑step *continuous‑time* TMLE (implemented via the **`concrete`** package)
directly targets these weighted risks, giving double‑robustness: correct either
the outcome model **or** the censoring model is sufficient for consistent
estimation.


# 6   Why these assumptions are plausible (or not) in claims data

* **Consistency / SUTVA:** Each patient’s AKI diagnosis is determined by their
  own regimen and physiology; spill‑over is unlikely.
* **Exchangeability:** We include rich baseline medical history from the claims
  data (CKD stage, eGFR, liver disease, etc.).  Residual confounding remains
  possible if, for instance, prescriber preference correlates with unmeasured
  kidney function.
* **Positivity:** Both SOF and non‑SOF regimens are widely used across all
  patient profiles in commercial and Medicare claims, but we will check
  overlap via propensity‑score diagnostics.
* **Independent censoring:** Switching is often triggered by rising creatinine,
  so naïve censoring would be informative.  IPCW mitigates this by modelling
  the switching hazard as a function of observed labs and comorbidities.


# 7   Take‑home message for pharmacoepidemiologists
The Identification step distils *clinical intent* into a pair of mathematically
precise contrasts and spells out exactly what we must believe about the data
for those contrasts to be recoverable.  Once these assumptions are on the
page, colleagues and reviewers can scrutinise them, and the subsequent
estimation step (Step 3) flows in a straight line from the formulas above.

*Next up:* we implement doubly‑robust estimation of these risks with
continuous‑time TMLE (`concrete`) and evaluate how sensitive the conclusions
are to the assumptions listed here.

### 2.2  Statistical Model Setup  

We begin by specifying the observed‐data structure for each study subject:

| Symbol | Description (HCV → AKI example) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **$W$** | Baseline covariates: age, sex, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, baseline eGFR, cirrhosis, healthcare utilisation, etc. |
| **$A$** | Indicator of the initial antiviral regimen (1 = sofosbuvir-containing, 0 = non-sofosbuvir). |
| **$T$** | Follow-up time (in days) to either first AKI, censoring, or study end. |
| **$\Delta$** | Event type: 1 = AKI, 0 = right censoring.  For the **primary dataset** we treat *regimen switching* as censoring; for the **ITT dataset** we ignore switching. |

The individual-level observed data vector is therefore  
\[
O \;=\; (W,\,A,\,T,\,\Delta)\;,
\]
and the statistical model is the non-parametric class  
\[
\mathcal{M} \;=\; \bigl\{P(O)\bigr\},
\]
i.e., all distributions consistent with the data schema above (no further
parametric restrictions).

---

### 2.3  Causal Parameters (Estimands)  

* **Primary estimand – Hypothetical “no-switch” risk difference / risk ratio**  
  *Counterfactual contrast of 90-day AKI risk if **every patient remained on the
initial regimen for the full 90 days**.*  
  \[
  \text{RD}_{\!\text{NS}} \;=\; E\!\bigl[Y^{a=1,\; \text{no-switch}} \bigr] -
                               E\!\bigl[Y^{a=0,\; \text{no-switch}} \bigr],
  \qquad\;
  \text{RR}_{\!\text{NS}} \;=\;
  \frac{E\!\bigl[Y^{a=1,\; \text{no-switch}}\bigr]}
       {E\!\bigl[Y^{a=0,\; \text{no-switch}}\bigr]}.
  \]

* **Sensitivity estimand – Treatment-policy (ITT) risk difference / risk ratio**  
  *Counterfactual contrast of 90-day AKI risk when patients are
  **started** on SOF vs non-SOF, **allowing real-world switching and
  discontinuation**.*  
  \[
  \text{RD}_{\!\text{ITT}} \;=\; E\!\bigl[Y^{a=1}\bigr] -
                                 E\!\bigl[Y^{a=0}\bigr],
  \qquad\;
  \text{RR}_{\!\text{ITT}} \;=\;
  \frac{E\!\bigl[Y^{a=1}\bigr]}
       {E\!\bigl[Y^{a=0}\bigr]}.
  \]

---

### 2.4  Key Identification Assumptions  

#### 2.4.1  Consistency  
For each subject the observed outcome equals the potential outcome under the
treatment actually received:
\[
Y \;=\; A\,Y^{a=1} + (1-A)\,Y^{a=0}.
\]
In the primary analysis we further assume that, had switching been prevented,
each individual’s potential outcome $Y^{a,\;\text{no-switch}}$ equals the
outcome we would observe *if* they indeed remained on their initial regimen.

#### 2.4.2  Conditional Exchangeability (Ignorability)  
After adjusting for baseline covariates $W$, initial regimen choice is as good
as random:
\[
Y^{a,\;\text{no-switch}} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; A \;\bigl|\, W,
\qquad
Y^{a} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; A \;\bigl|\, W.
\]
That is, no unmeasured baseline confounders influence both treatment choice
and AKI risk.

#### 2.4.3  Positivity  
Every covariate pattern observed in the data must have a non-zero probability
of receiving either regimen:
\[
0 \;<\; P(A=a \mid W)\;<\;1
\quad\text{for all } a\in\{0,1\},\; W \text{ with } P(W)>0.
\]

#### 2.4.4  Independent Censoring (Primary estimand only)  
For the hypothetical no-switch contrast we treat switching, death, and
disenrolment as censoring events.  Identification therefore additionally
requires
\[
Y^{a,\;\text{no-switch}} \;\perp\!\!\!\perp\; C \;\bigl|\, A, W,
\]
where $C$ is the censoring indicator.  In practice we relax this assumption by
using **inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting (IPCW)** within the
continuous-time TMLE so that censoring can depend on measured
time-varying information.

---

### 2.5  Identification Formulae  

Under the assumptions above, both estimands can be expressed as purely
statistical functionals of the observed-data distribution.  For example, the
g-formula for the ITT risk is
\[
E\bigl[Y^{a}\bigr]
  \;=\; E_{W}\!\bigl[\,E(Y \mid A=a, W)\bigr].
\]
The analogous expression for the no-switch estimand replaces the inner
expectation with the counterfactual risk under a sustained exposure, which we
evaluate using one-step TMLE implemented in the **`concrete`** package.

---

### 2.6  Practical Challenges  

* **Informative censoring (primary estimand).**  
  Because regimen switching may be triggered by early signs of nephro-toxicity,
  simple censoring is likely informative.  IPCW within TMLE adjusts for this,
  but relies on correctly modelling the switching hazard and on measured
  covariates capturing all reasons for switching.

* **Measurement error in AKI coding.**  
  AKI identified from claims may misclassify events.  Planned sensitivity
  analyses will repeat estimation with stricter ICD definitions (e.g.,
  dialysis, hospitalisation) to gauge robustness.

---

### 2.7  Summary  

By redefining the **primary estimand** as the 90-day risk difference/ratio
*under a hypothetical no-switch strategy*, and retaining the original ITT
contrast as a key **sensitivity analysis**, we align the identification step
with our updated scientific objectives.  All subsequent estimation and
inference will explicitly rely on the assumptions enumerated above and use the
continuous-time TMLE framework (`concrete`) to obtain doubly-robust estimates
of both causal contrasts.

## Introduction to Identification

Causal inference from observational data relies on translating causal questions into identifiable statistical parameters. The process of **causal identification** formally connects causal parameters to observed data distributions. It relies on three fundamental assumptions: 1. **Consistency** 2. **Conditional Exchangeability (Ignorability)** 3. **Positivity** We describe each assumption in detail below, linking explicitly to the causal question defined in Step 1.  # 2.2 Statistical Model Setup We first clearly specify the observed data structure and statistical model. In our AKI-HCV example, we define each observed data element: - **Baseline covariates (**$W$): Age, sex, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, baseline eGFR, liver disease status, and healthcare utilization. - **Treatment (**$A$): Initial regimen choice (SOF vs. non-SOF DAA). - **Outcome (**$Y$): Binary indicator for AKI occurrence within 90 days. - **Censoring (**$C$): Indicators for loss to follow-up due to death, regimen switching, or insurance disenrollment. Formally, each participant’s observed data are: $$ O = (W, A, C, Y) $$ Our statistical model, denoted as $\mathcal{M}$, is the nonparametric statistical model comprising all distributions consistent with the data structure above: $$ \mathcal{M} = \{P(O)\} $$ No parametric assumptions are made yet; flexibility is maintained.  # 2.3 Defining the Causal Parameter (Estimand) We now restate the primary causal parameter (estimand) selected in Step 1: - **Estimand:** Risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) comparing SOF-containing regimen versus non-SOF regimen at 90 days, under the **as-treated, censor-at-switch** strategy. In causal notation, this is expressed in terms of potential outcomes $Y^{a}$: - **Risk difference (RD)**: $$ \text{RD} = E[Y^{a=1}] - E[Y^{a=0}] $$ - **Risk ratio (RR)**: $$ \text{RR} = \frac{E[Y^{a=1}]}{E[Y^{a=0}]} $$ This contrasts the AKI risk under universal assignment to SOF-containing DAAs versus universal assignment to non-SOF DAAs.  # 2.4 Key Identification Assumptions We now explicitly define and discuss the identification assumptions required.  ## 2.4.1 Consistency **Consistency** ensures the observed outcome corresponds exactly to the potential outcome under the regimen actually received: - Formally: $$ Y = A \cdot Y^{a=1} + (1 - A) \cdot Y^{a=0} $$ - **Interpretation**: The observed AKI status must exactly reflect the causal effect of the actual regimen initiated.  ## 2.4.2 Conditional Exchangeability (Ignorability) **Conditional Exchangeability** states no unmeasured confounding after conditioning on $W$: - Formally: $$ Y^{a} \perp A \mid W $$ - **Interpretation**: There are no hidden baseline factors influencing both initial regimen choice and AKI risk. Practically, this means we've measured sufficient baseline covariates to eliminate confounding bias.  ## 2.4.3 Positivity (Overlap) **Positivity** requires nonzero probability of receiving each treatment for all relevant subgroups defined by $W$: - Formally: $$ 0 < P(A=a|W) < 1 \quad\text{for all relevant } W $$ - **Interpretation**: For every type of patient considered in the study, treatment choice (SOF vs. non-SOF) must be realistically possible. Violation of positivity creates problems for causal estimation; thus, careful assessment and diagnostics (e.g., checking propensity scores distributions) will be performed in Step 4.  # 2.5 Identification Result (G-computation Formula) Under these three assumptions, we formally identify the causal parameter as a purely statistical quantity (g-formula): - The causal estimand can be expressed as: $$ E[Y^a] = E_W\left[E(Y|A=a, W)\right] $$ - Therefore, the risk difference (RD) is explicitly: $$ RD = E_W\left[E(Y|A=1,W)\right] - E_W\left[E(Y|A=0,W)\right] $$ - Similarly, the risk ratio (RR) is: $$ RR = \frac{E_W\left[E(Y|A=1,W)\right]}{E_W\left[E(Y|A=0,W)\right]} $$ In practice, estimation (Steps 3–4) will rely on methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner to flexibly estimate these conditional expectations.  # 2.6 Practical Considerations and Challenges  ## 2.6.1 Informative Censoring Our estimand (as-treated censoring) assumes censoring events (e.g., regimen switching, death, disenrollment) are non-informative, conditional on measured covariates. Violations—called informative censoring—can bias results. - **Assessment:** Sensitivity analyses will evaluate robustness against censoring violations, including inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting (IPCW).  ## 2.6.2 Measurement Error AKI defined by ICD codes or claims data may suffer measurement error: - **Assessment:** Sensitivity analyses using alternative outcome definitions (e.g., hospitalization-required AKI, dialysis initiation) help ensure results' robustness.  # 2.7 Summary of Identification Clearly stating the identification assumptions upfront provides transparency and allows critical evaluation. Subsequent steps (estimation, sensitivity analyses) directly rely on these assumptions' validity.
