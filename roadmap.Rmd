0 Background and Motivation
Clinical signal. A case report suggested nephrotoxicity of sofosbuvir (SOF)‐containing DAA regimens. We ask whether initiation of a SOF regimen, compared with a non-SOF DAA, increases 90-day acute kidney injury (AKI) risk among adults with chronic HCV. Rapid model-based hazard-ratio analyses showed no clear signal but were limited by residual confounding.
Targeted Learning (TL) offers a prespecified, double-robust alternative.

1 Scientific Question and Estimand
Among treatment-naïve adults with chronic HCV starting a DAA, what is the 90-day causal effect of a SOF-containing regimen vs a non-SOF regimen on first AKI?


Attribute	Definition
Population	U.S. adults 18–79 y with ≥12 m continuous enrollment and chronic HCV diagnosis
Treatment	a = 1: initiate SOF-containing DAA; a = 0: initiate non-SOF DAA
Outcome	First AKI claim/EMR entry within 90 days
Intercurrent events	Death or regimen switch → censoring (“as-treated”, 30-day wash-out)
Summary measure	Marginal risk difference, risk ratio, and ATE at 90 days
2 Causal Model (DAG)
Insert DAG here with baseline covariates W, treatment A, censoring C(t) and outcome Y(t). No unblocked back-door paths after adjusting for W.

3 Statistical Model & Identification
We work in the non-parametric model M for
O = (W, A, Δ, Y).

Insert TMLE survival curves vs KM.

7 Limitations
Residual confounding by unmeasured CKD severity.

Claims-based AKI definition ~80 % sensitivity.

Generalizability: insured U.S. population.
