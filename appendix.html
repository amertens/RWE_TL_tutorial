<h1>Guidance on Estimands in RWE</h1>
<p>The importance of carefully choosing an estimand in non-randomized
studies has been recognized by regulatory agencies and researchers
alike: * ICH E9(R1) was originally written for clinical trials, but it
explicitly states its principles are also “relevant for observational
studies”. * The European Medicines Agency has reinforced these ideas for
RWE. A recent EMA reflection paper on use of real-world data stresses
designing observational studies to emulate a target trial, including
specification of “treatment conditions, outcome, causal contrasts
(i.e. the estimand) and analysis plan” (<a
href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/reflection-paper-use-real-world-data-non-interventional-studies-generate-real-world-evidence_en.pdf#"
class="uri">https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/reflection-paper-use-real-world-data-non-interventional-studies-generate-real-world-evidence_en.pdf#</a>:~:text=223%20treatment%20conditions%2C%20outcome%2C%20causal,hypothetical%20trial%20using%20epidemiological%20methods
). * It suggests a two-step approach: first, envision the ideal
randomized trial (with its estimand defined); second, design the
non-interventional study to mirror that trial as closely as possible. *
Notably, it advises that the estimand framework described in ICH E9(R1)
should be considered in the design of the hypothetical trial, including
the attributes of the estimand, intercurrent events, and strategies to
handle them. This is essentially endorsing the use of estimands in
observational study protocols. The EMA reflection paper points out that
this process helps investigators anticipate potential biases and choose
appropriate methods to address them – for example, recognizing that a
while-on-treatment estimand might require methods to handle informative
censoring is a proactive step that comes from explicitly stating that
estimand. * FDA Guidance on RWE: The FDA’s 2021 draft guidance
“Considerations for Non-Interventional Studies” similarly emphasizes
clear definition of the causal question and design elements. While it
doesn’t use the word estimand as heavily as ICH E9, it converges on the
same concept. FDA encourages the use of target trial emulation or other
rigorous frameworks to design RWE studies. In particular, sponsors are
asked to describe their “proposed approach to support causal inference
(e.g., target trial emulation) and to address confounding and other
biases” in the protocol. Target trial emulation involves spelling out
the hypothetical trial we wish we could do (with eligibility criteria,
treatment arms, follow-up, outcome, etc.), which is essentially defining
the estimand and analysis plan in observational terms. The FDA guidance
also lists critical study design elements that echo the estimand
attributes: e.g. the time zero (index date) for each arm, the follow-up
period and approach to censoring, and how to handle “depletion of
susceptibles” (which relates to loss of patients due to events). * All
these ensure that the study’s analysis truly answers the research
question of interest. In practice, if we were planning the SOF vs
non-SOF study for regulatory use, FDA would expect us to specify things
like: “Our primary objective is to estimate the hazard ratio for AKI
comparing initiators of SOF vs non-SOF. The estimand is defined as…
(population, treatments, outcome, etc.), with treatment discontinuation
handled by censoring (while-on-treatment strategy), and death handled as
a competing risk,” etc. By making these choices explicit, the study
becomes far more interpretable and reviewable. * Academic literature
(causal inference perspective): Researchers like Hernán, Robins, and
others have long advocated principles that are now embodied in the
estimand framework. For example, Hernán &amp; Robins (2016) introduced
the concept of the “target trial” for observational studies, outlining
key protocol components: population, treatment strategies, assignment
(not randomized in RWE but one can adjust for confounding), start of
follow-up (time zero), outcome, causal contrast of interest, and
analysis methods. * These correspond closely to defining an estimand and
analysis plan. By explicitly formulating a target trial, one implicitly
defines the estimand (the causal contrast) and how to deal with
deviations. Our SOF vs non-SOF example can be seen through this lens:
eligibility (HCV patients indicated for treatment), treatment strategies
(initiate SOF vs initiate non-SOF regimen; what happens on
discontinuation is part of strategy definition), time zero (treatment
start), follow-up (e.g. up to 3 months post-treatment or until AKI),
outcome (AKI per lab criteria), and causal contrast (hazard ratio). If
patients may switch, the target trial would specify whether that is
allowed (treatment-policy) or not (protocol treatment discontinuation →
censoring), which again is the estimand decision. Hernán &amp;
Scharfstein (2018) in Annals of Internal Medicine explicitly warn that
we should choose clinically meaningful treatment strategies in designing
trials and analyses, rather than defaulting to ITT for everything. They
give the example that an estimand which compares a policy of “treat
through toxicity” to “not treat” is not useful. This resonates with our
discussion: if a patient would normally stop SOF upon signs of kidney
injury, an analysis that imagines they didn’t stop (or that lumps them
in with continuers ala ITT) might not be answering a question anyone
cares about in practice. The literature also discusses using estimands
in contexts like comparative effectiveness and safety in observational
studies. For instance, an article in Pharmacoepidemiology &amp; Drug
Safety notes that defining an estimand in comparative effectiveness RWE
ensures the study “targets a treatment effect that aligns with the
treatment decision the study aims to inform.” This is a powerful guiding
principle: always ask, “what decision or scenario is this analysis
informing?” If it’s a prescribing decision (“Should I start patient on
SOF or not?”), perhaps a treatment-policy estimand (the effect of that
initial decision) is relevant. If it’s a management decision during
therapy (“Patient is on SOF – what is their ongoing risk of AKI?”), a
while-on-treatment estimand is directly relevant.</p>
<p>In summary, current regulatory guidance and methodological literature
all point to the same best practice: clearly define your estimand
(causal question) in observational studies, just as you would in a
randomized trial. This includes stating how you handle cross-overs,
discontinuations, and other intercurrent events, and ensuring that
choice aligns with the objective. By doing so, you improve the
credibility and relevance of RWE findings in the eyes of regulators and
clinicians. Our next step is to apply this guidance to recommend an
estimand for the SOF vs non-SOF AKI analysis.</p>
<p>#Estimand justification</p>
<p><strong>Estimand Justification:</strong> Clinical relevance and
causal clarity: This strategy is appropriate because the primary concern
is whether SOF induces acute kidney injury while it is being used.
Clinically, if a patient on SOF develops signs of nephrotoxicity, the
drug would be stopped. Thus, the relevant question is the drug’s effect
up until that point. By focusing on the period of exposure, we directly
measure the harm attributable to the drug. It isolates the window where
the pharmacological action of SOF could cause AKI. If instead we
included events long after SOF was stopped, those might not be caused by
SOF at all (or conversely, if SOF caused subclinical damage that later
manifested, that would usually occur soon after – in either case,
analyzing far-out outcomes dilutes interpretability). Our recommended
estimand mirrors the concept of “on-treatment safety analysis” commonly
used in clinical trials (often referred to as analyzing
treatment-emergent adverse events). Regulators reviewing a safety study
will expect to see the risk while the drug is actually taken, as this
informs labeling (e.g., “During treatment X, Y% of patients experienced
AKI, compared to Z% on the comparator”). Regulatory alignment: Using a
while-on-treatment estimand is consistent with regulatory thinking for
safety. ICH E9(R1) itself gives examples where “the value up until the
time of an intercurrent event” is the basis of the estimand for safety
or certain efficacy measures. In pharmacovigilance, regulators typically
want to know if a drug itself poses a danger. If many patients
discontinue SOF due to lesser side effects, an ITT-like estimand might
misleadingly show “no difference in AKI” simply because those
susceptible stopped early. A while-on-treatment estimand, by contrast,
would capture any AKI events that do occur during exposure, even if the
patient stopped immediately after. It provides a more direct assessment
of causality: Did AKI happen while on SOF (yes/no), and at what rate
compared to alternatives? This is very actionable information (it could
affect risk mitigation strategies, monitoring recommendations, etc.).
The FDA and EMA would appreciate that our study’s objective and analysis
align: we would state in the protocol that the goal is to estimate the
risk of AKI under continued treatment with vs without SOF, and our
analysis (censoring at changes) reflects that goal. Causal
interpretation: Under this estimand, if we find a higher hazard of AKI
in the SOF group, we can interpret it as “SOF (while being taken)
increases AKI risk” – a causal statement that is relatively unambiguous.
It answers the causal question of interest for clinicians: “If my
patient stays on SOF, are they more likely to get AKI than if they were
on a different regimen?” That’s essentially a per-protocol effect, which
is what we want for understanding safety. By contrast, an ITT effect
would answer something like, “if my patient starts on SOF (but might
stop if it causes issues) vs starts on something else (and might
switch), are they more likely to ever experience AKI?” – a fuzzier
question that mixes drug effect with patient management decisions.
Handling of intercurrent events in this estimand: We explicitly choose
the treatment-policy strategy for death (e.g., censor at death, treating
it separately) and the while-on-treatment strategy for treatment
discontinuation/switch. One could argue whether death should be a
competing risk (if death is unrelated, censoring is fine; if drug causes
death which prevents AKI, that’s another safety issue – but presumably
AKI is the specific outcome we’re targeting). For simplicity, we’d
censor at death or end of data. The key is we have declared what we do
for each event. If a patient switches from SOF to another DAA, we censor
at switch – thus, we’re not attributing any AKI after that to SOF. This
fits the estimand of effect while on initial treatment. We would also
plan sensitivity analyses to check robustness (for example, what if we
extend follow-up a bit after discontinuation to capture events shortly
after stopping drug? Does it matter?). Clinical and causal
considerations: Sofosbuvir-based regimens are typically of finite
duration (e.g., 12 weeks). A while-on-treatment estimand essentially
limits analysis to that period (and comparator’s equivalent period).
This makes comparisons fair and interpretation straightforward. If SOF
had some lingering effect on kidneys even after stopping, a purely
on-treatment analysis might miss it – but biologically, AKI is acute and
likely concurrent with exposure or shortly after. We could capture
events within, say, 4 weeks after the last dose and still call it “on
treatment” for analysis purposes (a common approach in trials is to
count events within 30 days of last dose as related to treatment). We
would justify this window based on clinical reasoning about drug
clearance and injury mechanisms. The recommended estimand also assumes
patients in both groups are at risk for AKI only while on their therapy;
this is reasonable as a starting point, and any violation (like rebound
effects) could be checked separately. Example estimand description (for
clarity): To make it very concrete, we might write in a protocol:
“Estimand: Among HCV-infected patients eligible for sofosbuvir therapy,
compare the proportion who experience AKI during treatment with a
SOF-containing regimen versus during treatment with a non-SOF regimen.
The intercurrent event of treatment discontinuation or switching is
handled with a treatment-period strategy (patients will be followed for
AKI up to the time they discontinue initial treatment, at which point
they are censored). The intercurrent event of death will be treated as a
censoring (patients who die before experiencing AKI will be censored at
death). The treatment effect measure will be a hazard ratio (SOF vs
non-SOF) for time-to-AKI during the treatment period.” This clearly
aligns the question and analysis. It would yield an answer such as,
“while on treatment, patients on SOF had X times the hazard of AKI
compared to patients on other regimens.” This is a result one can use to
infer causality and make clinical decisions (e.g., additional kidney
monitoring for patients on SOF if hazard is elevated). Equally suitable
alternatives? In this specific scenario, one could argue for a slight
variant: a composite estimand where we count certain intercurrent events
as part of the outcome. For example, if a patient discontinued SOF
explicitly due to renal impairment concerns, one might count that as a
safety outcome as well (since it’s essentially treatment failure due to
toxicity). Composite strategy was not explicitly asked in the question,
but it’s another approach: e.g., define the outcome as “AKI or drug
discontinuation for renal-related reasons.” This would address the issue
of informative censoring by essentially capturing those early signs of
trouble. However, defining such a composite requires reliable data on
reasons for discontinuation, and it changes the outcome of interest (it
becomes a compound outcome). If the focus is strictly laboratory-defined
AKI, we’d stick with AKI alone. Still, it’s worth noting as an
alternative: combining certain intercurrent events into the endpoint is
yet another estimand strategy (ICH E9 mentions it as the “composite
strategy”), commonly used when, say, death precludes measuring an
outcome – you might combine death and the outcome into one composite. In
our case, if death from any cause was a big risk and could occur before
AKI, a composite like “AKI or death” could be considered to avoid bias
by informative censoring of death. All things considered, the
while-on-treatment estimand is our recommended choice for primary
analysis, given the goal of assessing causality between SOF and AKI. It
provides a clear, actionable insight into the safety profile during
therapy, and it aligns with both clinical reasoning and regulatory
expectations for investigating adverse event risks.</p>
