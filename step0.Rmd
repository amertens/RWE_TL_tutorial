# 1 Summary of existing analysis


**Background and motivation.** A pharmacovigilance “dry-run” signal evaluation suggested a possible link between acute kidney injury (AKI) and sofosbuvir-containing (SOF) direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens used to treat chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. To inform ongoing safety monitoring, Gilead undertook a rapid, supportive real-world evidence (RWE) study comparing AKI risk in patients initiating SOF-containing DAAs with those starting non-SOF DAAs. The analysis leveraged a large US administrative-claims and electronic‐medical-record data source (HealthVerity) covering more than 550 million patients (2015-2023) to provide timely, supplementary evidence on whether the observed signal represented an increased, clinically meaningful risk.

**Methods.** A retrospective new-user cohort was drawn from an HCV “standing cohort” of adults with ≥1 year of continuous medical- and drug-coverage enrollment. Eligible initiators of SOF or non-SOF DAAs between 1 October 2016 and 21 September 2023 entered follow-up on the first dispense date (index). Exposure was handled “as treated”: patients were censored 31 days after treatment discontinuation or at crossover to the other DAA class. AKI was identified by ICD-10 codes (e.g., N17.x, N19, R34). Baseline demographics and 50+ comorbidities/medication variables were assessed in the prior year and used to build a logistic-regression propensity score (PS). After 1:1 nearest-neighbor PS matching, AKI incidence was compared with Cox proportional-hazards models: unadjusted, covariate-adjusted, PS-stratified and PS-matched specifications served as sensitivity and diagnostic checks.

**Results.** Among 105 636 eligible patients (67 720 non-SOF; 37 916 SOF), crude AKI incidence was 8.9 vs 16.0 per 1000 persons, but crude comparability was poor. PS matching produced 37 220 well-balanced pairs (absolute covariate differences ≤1%). In the matched analysis, AKI occurred in 608 SOF vs 605 non-SOF users over 26 387 person-years, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.14 (95% CI 1.00–1.30; p = 0.05) and an absolute risk difference of +7.1 AKI cases per 1000 patients . Fully covariate-adjusted and PS-stratified Cox models in the unmatched cohort gave similar, non-significant estimates (e.g., HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99–1.26) . Model diagnostics indicated adequate overlap and balance post-matching, but residual confounding could not be excluded. Overall, the analysis did not confirm an elevated AKI risk for SOF-containing DAAs; rather, after careful adjustment, risk estimates were null to modest and statistically inconclusive, suggesting the initial signal may reflect confounding or chance rather than a true safety concern.
