# Step 2 — Statistical Model and Causal Identification

The second step in the causal roadmap explicitly defines the statistical model and discusses assumptions necessary for causal identification. Clear articulation of these assumptions is crucial for valid causal inference.

## 2.1 Introduction to Identification

Causal inference from observational data relies on translating causal questions into identifiable statistical parameters. The process of **causal identification** formally connects causal parameters to observed data distributions. It relies on three fundamental assumptions: 1. **Consistency** 2. **Conditional Exchangeability (Ignorability)** 3. **Positivity** We describe each assumption in detail below, linking explicitly to the causal question defined in Step 1. \## 2.2 Statistical Model Setup We first clearly specify the observed data structure and statistical model. In our AKI-HCV example, we define each observed data element: - **Baseline covariates (**$W$): Age, sex, chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, baseline eGFR, liver disease status, and healthcare utilization. - **Treatment (**$A$): Initial regimen choice (SOF vs. non-SOF DAA). - **Outcome (**$Y$): Binary indicator for AKI occurrence within 90 days. - **Censoring (**$C$): Indicators for loss to follow-up due to death, regimen switching, or insurance disenrollment. Formally, each participant’s observed data are: $$ O = (W, A, C, Y) $$ Our statistical model, denoted as $\mathcal{M}$, is the nonparametric statistical model comprising all distributions consistent with the data structure above: $$ \mathcal{M} = \{P(O)\} $$ No parametric assumptions are made yet; flexibility is maintained. \## 2.3 Defining the Causal Parameter (Estimand) We now restate the primary causal parameter (estimand) selected in Step 1: - **Estimand:** Risk difference (RD) and risk ratio (RR) comparing SOF-containing regimen versus non-SOF regimen at 90 days, under the **as-treated, censor-at-switch** strategy. In causal notation, this is expressed in terms of potential outcomes $Y^{a}$: - **Risk difference (RD)**: $$ \text{RD} = E[Y^{a=1}] - E[Y^{a=0}] $$ - **Risk ratio (RR)**: $$ \text{RR} = \frac{E[Y^{a=1}]}{E[Y^{a=0}]} $$ This contrasts the AKI risk under universal assignment to SOF-containing DAAs versus universal assignment to non-SOF DAAs. \## 2.4 Key Identification Assumptions We now explicitly define and discuss the identification assumptions required. \### 2.4.1 Consistency **Consistency** ensures the observed outcome corresponds exactly to the potential outcome under the regimen actually received: - Formally: $$ Y = A \cdot Y^{a=1} + (1 - A) \cdot Y^{a=0} $$ - **Interpretation**: The observed AKI status must exactly reflect the causal effect of the actual regimen initiated. \### 2.4.2 Conditional Exchangeability (Ignorability) **Conditional Exchangeability** states no unmeasured confounding after conditioning on $W$: - Formally: $$ Y^{a} \perp A \mid W $$ - **Interpretation**: There are no hidden baseline factors influencing both initial regimen choice and AKI risk. Practically, this means we've measured sufficient baseline covariates to eliminate confounding bias. \### 2.4.3 Positivity (Overlap) **Positivity** requires nonzero probability of receiving each treatment for all relevant subgroups defined by $W$: - Formally: $$ 0 < P(A=a|W) < 1 \quad\text{for all relevant } W $$ - **Interpretation**: For every type of patient considered in the study, treatment choice (SOF vs. non-SOF) must be realistically possible. Violation of positivity creates problems for causal estimation; thus, careful assessment and diagnostics (e.g., checking propensity scores distributions) will be performed in Step 4. \## 2.5 Identification Result (G-computation Formula) Under these three assumptions, we formally identify the causal parameter as a purely statistical quantity (g-formula): - The causal estimand can be expressed as: $$ E[Y^a] = E_W\left[E(Y|A=a, W)\right] $$ - Therefore, the risk difference (RD) is explicitly: $$ RD = E_W\left[E(Y|A=1,W)\right] - E_W\left[E(Y|A=0,W)\right] $$ - Similarly, the risk ratio (RR) is: $$ RR = \frac{E_W\left[E(Y|A=1,W)\right]}{E_W\left[E(Y|A=0,W)\right]} $$ In practice, estimation (Steps 3–4) will rely on methods such as targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) and Super Learner to flexibly estimate these conditional expectations. \## 2.6 Practical Considerations and Challenges \### 2.6.1 Informative Censoring Our estimand (as-treated censoring) assumes censoring events (e.g., regimen switching, death, disenrollment) are non-informative, conditional on measured covariates. Violations—called informative censoring—can bias results. - **Assessment:** Sensitivity analyses will evaluate robustness against censoring violations, including inverse-probability-of-censoring weighting (IPCW). \### 2.6.2 Measurement Error AKI defined by ICD codes or claims data may suffer measurement error: - **Assessment:** Sensitivity analyses using alternative outcome definitions (e.g., hospitalization-required AKI, dialysis initiation) help ensure results' robustness. \## 2.7 Summary of Identification Clearly stating the identification assumptions upfront provides transparency and allows critical evaluation. Subsequent steps (estimation, sensitivity analyses) directly rely on these assumptions' validity.
